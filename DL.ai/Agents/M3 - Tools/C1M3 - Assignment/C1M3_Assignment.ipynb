    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring.

      "## Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae are crucial for understanding the complex interactions between nova ejecta and their surrounding environments. Here are some key studies and findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. RS Ophiuchi Observations\n",
      "RS Ophiuchi is one of the most studied recurrent novae. A recent study utilized low-frequency radio observations with MeerKAT and LOFAR during the 2021 outburst. The observations were interpreted as synchrotron emission resulting from the shock interaction between nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium (source: [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2626516)).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The 2011 Outburst of T Pyxidis\n",
      "Another significant event was the 2011 outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyxidis. Radio observations during this outburst revealed details about the ejecta mass and hinted at complex mass loss processes. These data were gathered under the Astrophysics Data System, supported by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and NASA (source: [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N)).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. The First Radio Detection of RS Ophiuchi\n",
      "The first radio detection of an outburst from a recurrent nova was also associated with RS Ophiuchi. The detected brightness temperature indicated a non-thermal origin for the radio emission, differing from typical classical novae (source: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0)).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Historical Perspective on Radio Observations\n",
      "Radio observations of novae, including recurrent and classical types, date back to the 1970s. Initially, these were interpreted as thermal free-free emissions. The continuous development in radio astronomy has provided more insights into the dynamics of such explosive events (source: [IOP Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac24ab/pdf)).\n",
      "\n",
      "These studies highlight the importance of radio observations in unraveling the mysteries surrounding recurrent novae, contributing to our understanding of their physical processes and the environments in which they occur.\n",

    "**Goal:** Implement `reflection_and_rewrite(report)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report. This involves two main tasks: crafting a precise prompt and setting up a correctly configured response call to the language model.\n",

    "### 1. Create a User Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Guide the language model to output a structured response in JSON format.\n",
    "- **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `\"reflection\"` and `\"revised_report\"`.\n",
    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

      "Radio observations of recurrent novae provide valuable insights into the physical processes occurring during a nova outburst. These observations help understand the ejecta mass, mass loss processes, and interactions between the ejected materials and the surrounding environment.\n",

      "### Key Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RS Ophiuchi Observations**  \n",
      "   The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi has been studied using low-frequency radio observations during its 2021 outburst. The data from instruments such as MeerKAT and LOFAR were utilized. The radio emission observed is primarily synchrotron emission, arising from the interaction between the nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium. This phenomenon allows researchers to model the shock interactions occurring during the nova outburst [InspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2626516).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T Pyxidis 2011 Outburst**  \n",
      "   The 2011 outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyxidis provided an opportunity for extensive radio observations, which revealed details about the ejecta mass and suggested complex mass loss behaviors. The observations, recorded in various radio frequencies, were crucial in estimating the mass of material ejected and its implications on the nova system's evolution [ADS Harvard](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Observations Across Classical and Recurrent Novae**  \n",
      "   While recurrent novae are rarer, observations are often limited to fewer events. However, the available radio observations of these events are crucial in improving our understanding of their unique emission characteristics. These emissions help differentiate recurrent events from classical novae and provide insights into their origins and evolutionary paths [ADS Harvard](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ASPC...93..165B).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations play a vital role in advancing our understanding of recurrent novae. By analyzing the emissions from these outbursts, researchers can gain insights into the underlying physical processes, such as mass ejection and shock interactions. Continued observations and modeling efforts are necessary to better understand these dynamic and complex phenomena.\n",

      "2. **T Pyxidis 2011 Outburst**  \n",
      "   The 2011 outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyxidis provided an opportunity for extensive radio observations, which revealed details about the ejecta mass and suggested complex mass loss behaviors. The observations, recorded in various radio frequencies, were crucial in estimating the mass of material ejected and its implications on the nova system's evolution [ADS Harvard](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **General Observations Across Classical and Recurrent Novae**  \n",
      "   While recurrent novae are rarer, observations are often limited to fewer events. However, the available radio observations of these events are crucial in improving our understanding of their unique emission characteristics. These emissions help differentiate recurrent events from classical novae and provide insights into their origins and evolutionary paths [ADS Harvard](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ASPC...93..165B).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations play a vital role in advancing our understanding of recurrent novae. By analyzing the emissions from these outbursts, researchers can gain insights into the underlying physical processes, such as mass ejection and shock interactions. Continued observations and modeling efforts are necessary to better understand these dynamic and complex phenomena.\n"
