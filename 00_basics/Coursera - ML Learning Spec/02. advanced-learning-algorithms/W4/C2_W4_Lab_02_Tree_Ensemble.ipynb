    "You have demonstrated how to look for the best value hyperparameter-by-hyperparameter. However, you should not overlook that as we experiment with one hyperparameter we always have to fix the others at some default values. This makes us only able to tell how the hyperparameter value changes with respect to those defaults. In princple, if you have 4 values to try out in each of the 3 hyperparameters being tuned, you should have a total of 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 combinations, however, the way you are doing will only give us 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 results. To try out all combinations, you can use a sklearn implementation called GridSearchCV, moreover, it has a refit parameter that will automatically refit a model on the best combination so you will not need to program it explicitly. For more on GridSearchCV, please refer to its [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)."

    "Now, the last model you will test in this lab is the Gradient Boosting model, called XGBoost. As you've seen in the lectures, the boosting methods train several trees, but instead of them being uncorrelated to each other, now the trees are fitted subsequently to minimize the error. \n",

This is how we can automatically control how many estimators is enough, and how we can avoid overfitting due to too many estimators.\n",
