Overview
--------
This dataset contains example utterances and their corresponding intents from
the Customer Service domain. The data can be used to train intent recognition models
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platforms.

The dataset covers the "Customer Service" domain and includes 27 intents
grouped in 11 categories. These intents have been selected from Bitext's collection
of 20 domain-specific datasets (banking, retail, utilities...), keeping the intents
that are common across domains. See below for a full list of categories and intents.

Utterances
----------
The dataset contains over 8,000 utterances, with a varying number of utterances
per intent, including language register variations such as politeness, colloquial,
swearing, indirect style... To select the utterances, we use stratified sampling
to generate a dataset with a general user language register profile.

The dataset also reflects commonly occurring linguistic phenomena
of real-life chatbots, such as:
  - spelling mistakes
  - run-on words
  - missing punctuation

Contents
--------
Each entry in the dataset contains an example utterance from the Customer Service
domain, along with its corresponding intent, category and additional linguistic information.
Each line contains the following four fields:
  - flags: the applicable linguistic flags
  - utterance: an example user utterance
  - category: the high-level intent category
  - intent: the intent corresponding to the user utterance

Linguistic flags
----------------
The dataset contains annotations for linguistic phenomena, which can be used
to adapt bot training to different user language profiles. These flags are:
  B - Basic syntactic structure
  C - Complex/Coordinated syntactic structure
  E - Expanded abbreviations (I'm -> I am, I'd -> I would…)
  I - Interrogative structure
  K - Keyword only
  L - Lexical variation (synonyms)
  M - Morphological variation (plurals, tenses…)
  P - Politeness variation
  Q - Colloquial variation
  W - Offensive language
  Z - Noise (spelling, punctuation…)

These phenomena make the training dataset more effective
and make bots more accurate and robust.
