Overview
--------
This dataset contains example utterances and their corresponding intents from the Customer Support domain. The data can be used to train intent recognition models Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platforms.

The dataset covers the "Customer Support" domain and includes 27 intents grouped in 11 categories. These intents have been selected from Bitext's collection of 20 domain-specific datasets (banking, retail, utilities...), keeping the intents that are common across domains. See below for a full list of categories and intents.

Utterances
----------
The dataset contains over 20,000 utterances, with a varying number of utterances per intent. These utterances have been extracted from a larger dataset of 288,000 utterances (approx. 10,000 per intent), including language register variations such as politeness, colloquial, swearing, indirect style... To select the utterances, we use stratified sampling to generate a dataset with a general user language register profile.

The dataset also reflects commonly ocurring linguistic phenomena of real-life chatbots, such as:
  - spelling mistakes
  - run-on words
  - missing punctuation

Contents
--------
Each entry in the dataset contains an example utterance from the Customer Support domain, along with its corresponding intent, category and additional linguistic information. Each line contains the following four fields:
  - flags: the applicable linguistic flags
  - utterance: an example user utterance
  - category: the high-level intent category
  - intent: the intent corresponding to the user utterance

Linguistic flags
----------------
The dataset contains annotations for linguistic phenomena, which can be used to adapt bot training to different user language profiles. These flags are:
  B - Basic syntactic structure
  S - Syntactic structure
  L - Lexical variation (synonyms)
  M - Morphological variation (plurals, tenses…)
  I - Interrogative structure
  C - Complex/Coordinated syntactic structure
  P - Politeness variation
  Q - Colloquial variation
  W - Offensive language
  E - Expanded abbreviations (I'm -> I am, I'd -> I would…)
  D - Indirect speech (ask an agent to…)
  Z - Noise (spelling, punctuation…)

These phenomena make the training dataset more effective and make bots more accurate and robust.
