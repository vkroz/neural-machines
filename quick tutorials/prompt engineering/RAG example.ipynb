    "\n",
    "Handling extensive documents can be problematic for RAG due to their potential to exceed the context window's capacity. To manage this, documents are typically divided into smaller segments. This division not only facilitates the retrieval of the most pertinent segments by the retriever but also prevents the need to process the whole document through an LLM at once. In this segment, we utilize the [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/text_splitter/langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html), a standard [text splitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/#text-splitters) tool in LangChain. This splitter operates by taking an array of separators, initially splitting the text using the first separator, and progressing to subsequent separators if the resulting segments are still excessively large.\n"

    "Finally, let's  assemble the text generation with the LLM and the retriever. The query to the model is converted into a vector using the embedding model. This query vector represents the semantic meaning of the user's query. To find the most relevant documents to the user's query, we use a process called \"vector similarity search\". In essence, this process compares the query vector with all the document vectors in the database, finding the ones most similar to the query vector. The similarity between vectors is typically measured using the \"cosine similarity\", which captures the angle between the vectors in a multidimensional space. The documents corresponding to the most similar vectors are then returned as the search results.\n",
